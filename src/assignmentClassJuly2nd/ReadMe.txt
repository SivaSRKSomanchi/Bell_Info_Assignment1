Search/Access time for ArrayList: O(1). 
Access time for LinkedList: O(n)
In an array, you can access to any element by using array[index], while in a linked list you must navigate 
through all the list starting from first until you get the element you need.
Search Time of class java.util.ArrayList is 4

While in ArrayList, it has to create duplicate array and deletes the required
