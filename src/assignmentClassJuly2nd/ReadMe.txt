Insetion of Elements: LinkedList has better performance than ArrayList.
Insertion Time of class java.util.ArrayList is 2010 MilliSeconds
Insertion Time of class java.util.LinkedList is 470 MilliSeconds

Search/Access time for ArrayList: O(1). 
Access time for LinkedList: O(n)
In an array, you can access to any element by using array[index], while in a linked list you must navigate 
through all the list starting from first until you get the element you need.
Search Time of class java.util.ArrayList is 1 MilliSeconds
Search Time of class java.util.LinkedList is 181 MilliSeconds

Deletion Time is less for linked List. It just traverse through the list and deletes the specific node there
While in ArrayList, it has to create duplicate array and deletes the required 
element there and then merge the rest of the part.
Deletion Time of class java.util.ArrayList is 1902 MilliSeconds
Deletion Time of class java.util.LinkedList is 161 MilliSeconds
