HashSet vs. TreeSet vs. LinkedHashSet
Performance Testing..
HashSet gives better performance than the LinkedHashSet and TreeSet.
O(1) for insertion, removal and retrieval operations.
Insertion Time of class java.util.HashSet is 2 MilliSeconds

TreeSet gives less performance than the HashSet and LinkedHashSet as it has to 
sort the elements after each insertion and removal operations.
O(log(n)) for insertion, removal and retrieval operations.
Insertion Time of class java.util.TreeSet is 4 MilliSeconds

The performance of LinkedHashSet is almost similar to HashSet. 
But slightly slow as it maintains LinkedList internally to maintain the insertion order of elements.
Here also, O(1) for insertion, removal and retrieval operations.
Insertion Time of class java.util.LinkedHashSet is 1 MilliSeconds
